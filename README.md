# Roblox Biome Detector & Discord Notifier

This Python script monitors Roblox log files for specific biome detection events from BloxstrapRPC and sends these notifications, along with a link to the game server, directly to a Discord webhook.

## Features

* **Real-time Log Monitoring:** Continuously tails the newest Roblox log file for presence updates.
* **Biome Detection:** Identifies biome information from BloxstrapRPC entries in the logs.
* **Discord Webhook Integration:** Sends embeds to Discord.
* **Timestamped Notifications:** Each Discord notification includes the time the biome was detected.
* **Player Server Link:** Includes a clickable "Join Server" link in the Discord embed, pulled from your configuration.
* **EasyExit:** Easily stop the script by pressing the `F2` key.
* **Dynamic Log Switching:** Automatically switches to the newest log file if Roblox creates a new one (e.g., after a new game session).

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have installed:

* **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **`requests` library**: For sending HTTP requests to Discord webhooks.
* **`keyboard` library**: For detecting the F2 key press to stop the script.
* **Bloxstrap (with Activity Tracking Enabled)**: The script specifically looks for logs generated by Bloxstraps Activity Tracking (BloxstrapRPC).
* **Roblox**: The game itself diddo.

### Installation of Python Libraries

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests keyboard
```

## Setup

1.  **Create `config.ini`:**
    In the same directory as your `main.pyw` script, create a file named `config.ini`. This file will store your Discord webhook URL and the Roblox private server link.

    ```ini
    [Main]
    WebhookLink=YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE
    PSLink=YOUR_ROBLOX_PRIVATE_SERVER_LINK_HERE
    ```

    * **`WebhookLink`**: Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE` with your actual Discord webhook URL. You can create one in your Discord server settings under `Integrations -> Webhooks`.
    * **`PSLink`**: Replace `YOUR_ROBLOX_PRIVATE_SERVER_LINK_HERE` with the private server link you want to include in the Discord embeds. This is typically a Roblox game link followed by `?privateServerLinkCode=...`.

2.  **Ensure BloxstrapRPC is Running:**
    This script relies on BloxstrapRPC to write specific presence data to the Roblox logs. Make sure BloxstrapRPC is active and configured correctly.

---

## How to Run

Navigate to the directory containing your script and `config.ini` in your command prompt or PowerShell.

```bash
cd path\to\YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
```

Then execute the script using Python:

```bash
python main.pyw
```

**Note:** The `keyboard` library might require the script to be run with **administrative privileges** (Run as Administrator) to detect global hotkeys like `F2` properly, especially on Windows.

---

## Stopping the Script

To gracefully stop the script at any time, simply press the `F2` key. The script will detect this and shut down.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **`SyntaxError: invalid syntax` on line 1 when running:** This usually means you're trying to run the script incorrectly. Ensure you're using `python main.pyw` in your command line, not including symbols like `&` unless specifically in PowerShell with correct syntax.
* **"Config file NOT found" error:** Double-check that your `config.ini` file is in the *same directory* as `main.pyw`. Ensure it's spelled `config.ini` exactly.
* **"Section '[Main]' not found" or "Key 'WebhookLink' not found" errors:** Verify that your `config.ini` has the `[Main]` section header and that `WebhookLink=` and `PSLink=` are correctly written within that section, with an equals sign separating the key and its value.
* **Webhook not sending / Link not appearing:**
    * Ensure your `WebhookLink` is correct and active.
    * Check your internet connection.
    * Verify the `PSLink` in `config.ini` is a valid URL.
* **F2 key not stopping the script:**
    * Make sure the `keyboard` library is installed (`pip install keyboard`).
    * Try running your command prompt/PowerShell **as Administrator**.
* **"No log files found"**: Ensure Roblox is running and BloxstrapRPC is actively logging to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\logs`.
