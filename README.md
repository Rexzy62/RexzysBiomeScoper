# Roblox Biome Detector & Discord Notifier

This Python script monitors Roblox log files for specific biome detection events from BloxstrapRPC and sends these notifications, along with a link to the game server, directly to a Discord webhook.

## Features

* **Real-time Log Monitoring:** Continuously tails the newest Roblox log file for presence updates.
* **Biome Detection:** Identifies biome information from BloxstrapRPC entries in the logs.
* **Discord Webhook Integration:** Sends embeds to Discord.
* **Timestamped Notifications:** Each Discord notification includes the time the biome was detected.
* **Player Server Link:** Includes a clickable "Join Server" link in the Discord embed, pulled from your configuration.
* **EasyExit:** Easily stop the script by pressing the `F2` key.
* **Dynamic Log Switching:** Automatically switches to the newest log file if Roblox creates a new one (e.g., after a new game session).

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have installed:

* **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **`requests` library**: For sending HTTP requests to Discord webhooks.
* **`keyboard` library**: For detecting the F2 key press to stop the script.
* **Bloxstrap (with Activity Tracking Enabled)**: The script specifically looks for logs generated by Bloxstraps Activity Tracking (BloxstrapRPC).
* **Roblox**: The game itself diddo.

### Installation of Python Libraries

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests keyboard
```

## Setup

1.  **Open `RUNTHIS.ahk`:**
    In the same directory as your `main.py` script, open up the File Called `RUNTHIS.ahk` this has the most Basic of Settings.

2.  **Ensure Bloxstrap is Running:**
    This script relies on Bloxstrap to write specific presence data to the Roblox logs. Make sure Bloxstrap is active and configured correctly.

3. **Setup your Settings:**
    The Config is still Empty and **WILL NOT** work since the Biome Config isnt Setup so open up `Edit.pyw` (via `RUNTHIS.ahk` or the File Explorer) and Setup Everything.

4. **Running the Script**
    Simply go into `RUNTHIS.ahk` and Use the Start Button! (to stop the script press F2!).

## Troubleshooting

* **`SyntaxError: invalid syntax` on line 1 when running:** This usually means you're trying to run the script incorrectly. Ensure you're using `python main.py` in your command line, not including symbols like `&` unless specifically in PowerShell with correct syntax (this only Applies when Starting the `main.py` via powershell which i dont recommend).
* **"Config file NOT found" error:** Double-check that your `config.ini` file is in the *same directory* as `main.pyw`. Ensure it's spelled `config.ini` exactly.
* **"Section '[Main]' not found" or "Key 'WebhookLink' not found" errors:** Verify that your `config.ini` has the `[Main]` section header and that `WebhookLink=` and `PSLink=` are correctly written within that section, with an equals sign separating the key and its value.
* **Webhook not sending / Link not appearing:**
    * Ensure your `WebhookLink` is correct and active.
    * Check your internet connection.
    * Verify the `PSLink` in `config.ini` is a valid URL.
* **F2 key not stopping the script:**
    * Make sure the `keyboard` library is installed (`pip install keyboard`).
    * Try running your command prompt/PowerShell **as Administrator**.
* **"No log files found"**: Ensure Roblox is running and BloxstrapRPC is actively logging to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\logs`.
